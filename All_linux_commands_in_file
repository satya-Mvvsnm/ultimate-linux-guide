3. File management in Linux:

(a)File and Directory Management

<-> touch filename - To create a file

<-> ll or ls - To see list of files

<-> rm filename - To remove any file with permissions

<-> mv old_name new_name – Moves or renames a file or directory.

(b) How to change directories(cd)

<-> cd foldername - used to change the directory

<-> cd - used to get root directory

<-> cd -  - uesd to go previous folder

<-> cd ../  -   Used to go to one folder back

<-> cd ../ ../  -   Used to go to two folders back

<-> PWD - Present working directory


4.VI Editor Shortcuts:

(a) Normal Mode (default) – Used for navigation and command execution.

<-> gg     - Used to go firstline of a file

<-> 7gg    - Used to go  7th of a file

<-> G      - Move to the end of the file

<-> M     - Move to the middle of the file

<-> :9    – Move to line number nine

(b) Insert Mode – Used for text editing (press i to enter, Esc to exit).
Insert Mode Shortcuts:
<-> i   – Insert before cursor

<-> Esc  – Exit insert mode

<-> I – Used to go starting of the line

<-> A – Used to go end of the line

<-> o – Create a new line below

<-> O – Create a new line above

Editing Text:

<-> yy - Used to copy the line

<-> p - Used to print the copied content

<-> u - used to undo

<-> Ctrl + r - Used to redo

<-> dd – Delete a line 

Search and Replace
<-> /word  - Used to search for aword in a file

<-> :%s/old word/new word  - Used to replace a word in a file.

(c) Command Mode – Used for saving, quitting, and searching (press : in Normal mode):

<-> :w – Save file

<-> :wq – Save and exit

<-> :q! – Quit without saving

5. File Permissions Management in Linux:

CHANGE PERMISSIONS OF A FILE:

<-> chmod 777 filename - To change full permissions of a file

<-> chmod 777 filename1 filename2 - To change full permissions of a multiple files.

<-> chmod 777 * - To change full permissions of all file

<-> chmod 777 foldername - To change full permissions of a folder

<-> chmod 777 foldername -R  - To change full permissions of a folder along with files inside the folder.

<-> chmod 777 foldername/*   - To change full permissions of a file which are present inside a folder 

CHANGE OWNERS OF A FILE:

<-> chown username:groupname filename - To change owners of a file

<-> chown username:groupname filename1 filename2  - To change owners of a multiple files

<-> chown username:groupname * - To change owners of all file

<-> chown username:groupname foldername - To change owners of a folder

<-> chown username:groupname foldername -R - To change owners of a folder along with files inside the folder.

<-> chown username:groupname foldername/* - To change owners of a file which are present inside a folder.

<-> chown username  - To change user owner

<-> chgrp groupname - To change group owner

6. Process Management in Linux:

(a) Viewing or checking Processes: 

<-> ps  - the list of running process

<-> ps aux  –  View all running processes

<-> ps aux | nl or  ps aux | wc -l  –  View all running processes along with numbers

<-> ps aux - we can see memory and cpu utilisation

<-> ps -ef - we can't see memeory and cpu utilisation.

<-> ps -u username – Show processes for a specific user

<-> ps -C processname – Show a process by name

<-> pgrep processname - Find a process by name and return its PID

<-> pidof processname  - Find the PID of a running program

(b) Managing Processes:

Killing Processes:

<-> kill PID  -  To terminate a process by PID

<-> pkill processname - To terminate using process name

<-> kill -9 PID  - Force kill a process

<-> pkill -9 processname  -  Kill all instances of a process

Stopping & Resuming Processes:

<-> kill -STOP PID –   Stop a running process

<-> kill -CONT PID –   Resume a stopped process

Changing Process Priority:

<-> top   - View process priorities

<-> renice -n 10 -p PID  # Lower priority (positive values)
<-> renice -n -5 -p PID  # Higher priority (negative values, root required)

Daemon Processes: Daemon processes run in the background without user intervention

<-> systemctl list-units --type=service  - List all system daemons

<-> systemctl start service-name  - Start a daemon

<-> systemctl stop service-name  - Stop a daemon

<-> systemctl enable service-name - Enable a service at startup

7.Introduction to System Monitoring

(a).CPU and Memory Monitoring:
nproc - no of cpus

<-> top –   Real-time system monitoring

<-> htop – Interactive process viewer (requires installation)

<-> vmstat – To check CPU, memory, and I/O stats

<-> free -m – Show memory usage

(b) Disk Monitoring:

<-> df -h  - Check available disk space

<-> du -sh /path   – Show disk usage of a specific directory

<-> iostat   – Display CPU and disk I/O statistics
